In education, the primary objective is to educate users, and it encompasses two distinct sides; the admin side and the user side. 

On the admin side, administrators are granted special privileges and functionalities. They have the ability to upload educational videos, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive collection of content. Moreover, administrators can efficiently manage the video library by editing or deleting videos as needed. Additionally, administrators can retrieve comprehensive details of all the videos available within the system. This includes information such as titles, descriptions, duration, and the video.

On the user side, individuals are provided with the opportunity to access and engage with the educational videos. Users can freely explore the library of videos and select topics of interest based on their learning needs. This grants them the flexibility to watch videos at their own pace, enabling a personalized and self-directed learning experience. By offering a user-friendly interface, the function aims to create an engaging and seamless experience for users, encouraging them to actively participate in the educational process.

Health category is on collecting pharmaceuticals and sanitary products in order to distribute in the African region. I have implemented a form to gather important details such as the donation product name , donor name, quantity, description, and user address. Users can fill the forms under these details. Additionally they have the ability to edit or delete their donations, and they can also access a list of all their donations. 
To prevent data duplication, an auto-generated ID is used as the primary key for storing information. Overall, the system is designed to efficiently manage the collection  of the donations while providing a user-friendly experience.

The last category is digital bridge where users can read the posts in sinhala.
